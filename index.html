                <p>Ingredients</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>1 cup white basmati rice</li>
                  <li>salt and black pepper</li>
                  <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                  <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
                  <li>2 pints cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
                  <li>1 eggplant (about 1 pound), cut into ½-inch pieces</li>
                  <li>1½ teaspoons curry powder</li>
                  <li>1 15.5-ounce can chickpeas, rinsed</li>
                  <li>½ cup fresh basil</li>
                  <li>¼cup soy yoghurt, optional</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In a medium saucepan with a tight-fitting lid, combine the rice, 1½ cups water, and ½ teaspoon salt and bring to a boil. Stir the rice once, cover, and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 18 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes. </p>
                <p>Meanwhile, heat the oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 4 to 6 minutes. </p>
                <p> Stir in the tomatoes, eggplant, curry powder, 1 teaspoon salt, and ¼ teaspoon black pepper. </p>
                <p>Cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add 2 cups water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, until eggplant is tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Stir in the chickpeas and cook just until heated through, about 3 minutes. </p>
                <p>Remove the vegetables from heat and stir in the basil. Fluff the rice with a fork. Serve the vegetables over the rice with yogurt, if using.</p>

                <h3>Springrolls</h3>
                <img src="img/springroll.jpg">
                <p>Ingredients</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>a package of rice paper / spring roll paper</li>
                  <li>nori sheets</li>
                  <li>1/2 large cucumber, cut into strips</li>
                  <li>2 carrots, skinned and cut into strips</li>
                  <li>1-2 hass avocados, cut into strips</li>
                  <li>5-10 green onions, cut in half to shorten length</li>
                  <li>one bunch of sprouts or frisée</li>
                  <li>8 romaine lettuce or cabbage leaves, cutting out thick ribs</li>
                  <li>vegan cream cheese (optional)</li>
                  <li>sesame seeds (as garnish)</li>
                  <li>6 tablespoons Tamari or soy sauce</li>
                  <li>1 large garlic clove, minced</li>
                  <li>1/2 teaspoon Wasabi powder (optional)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For the nori flakes, take a package of nori sheets, put it in a blender/food processor, and blend until the nori is milled. </p>
                <p> Cut your cucumbers, carrots, and avocados into 3-4 inch (7-10 cm) strips. The green onions can stay intact. Cut out the thick ribs from the lettuce. Have an assembly station ready: rice paper, a large bowl or pie pan filled with warm water, a plate for creating/rolling the wraps, and a plate to place your rolls when they are done. </p>
                <p> When ready, place a sheet of rice paper in the warm water for 10 seconds. The paper will start to soften. </p>
                <p> Next, place the softened rice paper on the assembly plate. In the middle of the paper, spread your cream cheese (optional), sprinkle a pinchful of nori flakes, and place on your cucumbers, carrots, green onion, avocado, and sprouts.</p>
                <p> As for the lettuce, if you are using romaine, try to compact it on top of your veggies as much as possible to make rolling easier. Roll your spring roll like a wrap; take a horizontal edge and wrap it around the vegetables, fold the sides in, and continue to wrap until everything is secure.</p>
                <p> Make the dipping sauce by taking wasabi powder, minced garlic, and Tamari (or soy sauce). Whisk together and place in a bowl. Garnish with sesame seeds and enjoy!

                  <li> 1.5 tsp chili powder </li>
                  <li> Salt/pepper to taste </li>
                  <li> 1 tbsp olive oil </li>
                  <p> Extras:</p>
                  <li> Buns </li>
                  <li> Lettuce / Tomato </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p> First get a stove top pan and add 1/4 cup of water to it, (leave it off)
            Start pealing and chopping (if not using frozen bag) your sweet potatoes and placing them in the pan with the a TINY splash of water, once added turn on medium heat and cover the pan with a lid and let simmer until soft, 20-30 minutes depending on how small you chopped the sweet potatoes. (they should be mash-able with a fork or spoon like mashed potatoes). </p>
            <p>
            Prep the rest of your ingredients, chop your onion and place in a large bowl, add your black beans that have been drained and rinsed, add your corn, add your rice and peppers if choosing to! </p>
            <p>
            Once potatoes are cooked and soft turn off the heat, using a spoon smash them until they look like mashed potatoes, some lumps are ok but try to get rid of as many as possible.
            Add the smashed sweet potatoes to the other mixture of ingredients and mix everything together</p>
            <p>
            Add your olive oil if using, salt, pepper, chili powder and mix everything well!

               <h3>Curried Coconut Quinoa and Greens with Roasted Cauliflower</h3>
               <img src="img/COOK11.jpg">
                <p>Ingredients</p>
                <ul>
                 <p>Roasted Cauliflower</p>
                  <li>1 head cauliflower, cut into bite-sized florets </li>
                  <li>2 tablespoons melted coconut oil or olive oil</li>
                  <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
                  <li>Sea salt</li>
                  <p>Curried coconut quinoa with greens</p>
                  <li>2 teaspoons melted coconut oil or olive oil</li>
                  <li>1 medium yellow onion, chopped</li>
                  <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
                  <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
                  <li>½ teaspoon curry powder of choice (optional)</li>
                  <li>½ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
                  <li>1 can (14 ounces) light coconut milk</li>
                  <li>½ cup water</li>
                  <li>1 cup quinoa, rinsed well in a fine mesh colander</li>
                  <li>⅓ cup raisins</li>
                  <li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>
                  <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
                  <li>4 cups baby arugula or chopped chard, spinach, maybe even kale*</li>
                  <li> Optional garnishes: 2 green onions, chopped, and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p> Roast the cauliflower:</p>
            <p>
            Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Toss the cauliflower florets with coconut oil, cayenne pepper and a light sprinkle of sea salt. Roast for 25 to 30 minutes on the middle rack, turning halfway, until the cauliflower is tender and golden on the edges.</p>
            <p>
            Cook the quinoa:</p>
            <p>
            In a large pot with a lid, warm the coconut oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until it is turning translucent, stirring often, about 5 minutes. Add the ginger, turmeric, curry powder and cardamom and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour in the coconut milk, water, rinsed quinoa and raisins. Bring the mixture to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to a simmer. Cook for 15 minutes, then remove the pot from heat and let it rest for 5 minutes.</p>
            <p>
            Fluff the quinoa with a fork. Stir in the salt, vinegar and greens (if you intend to eat this dish as leftovers, I recommend storing leafy greens separate from the quinoa, as the greens don't reheat well). Divide the quinoa into bowls and top with roasted cauliflower. Garnish with green onions and red pepper flakes if you'd like.</p>

                <li>2 carrots</li>
                <li>1 yellow onion/li>
                <li>2 3-oz. bricks of ramen noodles</li>
                <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
                <li>3 Tbsp brown sugar</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp hot sauce (or less)</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp cornstarch</li>
                <li>3 green onions, sliced</li>
                <li>handful cilantro (optional)</li>
                <li>1 cup quinoa, rinsed well in a fine mesh colander</li>
                <li>⅓ cup raisins</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
                <li>4 cups baby arugula or chopped chard, spinach, maybe even kale*</li>
                <li> Optional garnishes: 2 green onions, chopped, and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes</li>
              </ul>
            <p>1. Remove the core and any wilted outer leaves from the cabbage, then cut it into very fine strips. Cut the onion and green bell pepper into thin strips as well. Use a large holed cheese grater to shred the carrots.</p>
            <p>2. In a small bowl prepare the sauce by stirring together the soy sauce, brown sugar, sriracha, and corn starch.</p>
            <p>3. Begin to cook the noodles according to the package directions (boil for 3 minutes, or until tender). Drain the cooked noodles in a colander.</p>
            <p>4. Heat the vegetable oil over medium high heat in a large skillet until it is hot and shimmering. Add the vegetables and sauté for only a few minutes, or until the vegetables just begin to soften. Pour the prepared sauce into the skillet and continue to sauté for one to two minutes more, or until the sauce has thickened and coated all of the vegetables. Turn off the heat.</p>
            <p>5. Add the cooked and drained noodles to the stir fried vegetables and toss to combine. Top with sliced green onions and a handful of fresh cilantro, if desired.</p>

(Green lentils usually take about 25 to 30 minutes to cook, while red ones require closer to 20 minutes.) While the quinoa and lentils are cooking, prepare the dressing: Whisk together the shallot, mustard, and lemon juice. Add the oil slowly, whisking until emulsified. Season with the salt and pepper. Mix the prepared quinoa and lentils with the chopped parsley in a large bowl. Pour the dressing over the quinoa, lentil, and parsley mixture and mix well. Serve warm or cold.</p>

                <li>1/4 cup celery</li>
                <li>1/2 cup tomatoes</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vegan Worcestershire sauce</li>
                <li>2 teaspoon hot sauce</li>
                <li>3/4 cup rice</li>

            <p>To prepare vegetables, peel and cut the butternut squash into 1/2" cubes. Measure out roughly 3 cups and save the rest for use in another recipe. Dice the onion, peppers, celery, and tomatoes. In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add onions, peppers, and celery to oil. Cook onions until they begin to soften, about three minutes then add in garlic, squash, tomatoes. Continue to cook for 2-3 more minutes then pour in the Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, and rice. Cook rice in mixture for 1-2 minutes before adding liquids. Finally, add remaining ingredients, bring to a boil, and reduce then to a simmer. Stir often until rice absorbed all the liquid (about 20-30 minutes- this really depends on your heat source) Remove from heat and serve.</p>

              <img src="img/Cook17.jpg">
              <p>Ingredients</p>
              <ul>
                <li>1 tablespoon coconut oil or olive oil</li>
                <li>1½ teaspoons cumin seeds (scale back a little if you're not crazy about cumin)</li>
                <li>1 yellow onion, chopped</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon pressed or minced fresh garlic (about 5 cloves)</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon peeled and minced fresh ginger (about a 1-inch piece)</li>
                <li>1 green Serrano pepper, minced</li>
                <li>1½ teaspoons garam masala (or tikka masala)</li>
                <li>1½ teaspoons ground coriander</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
                <li>¾ teaspoon fine-grain sea salt</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
                <li>1 can (28 ounces) whole peeled tomatoes, with their juices</li>
                <li>2 cans (14 ounces each) chickpeas (or 3 cups cooked chickpeas), drained and rinsed</li>
                <li>1 cup uncooked brown basmati rice, for serving (rice is optional, I like to cook extra rice to have on hand for other meals)</li>
                <li>Lemon wedges, for garnishing</li>
                <li>Fresh cilantro, chopped, for garnishing (optional)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>1. Cook the rice (if you want to serve the chana masala on rice): Bring a large pot of water to boil on the stove. Pour in the rice and give it a stir. Boil the rice for 30 minutes, then turn off the heat and drain the rice. Return the rice to the pot and cover the pot. Let the rice steam for 10 minutes. Remove the lid, fluff the rice with a fork and season with sea salt to taste.</p>
              <p>2. Cook the chana masala: In a Dutch oven or large saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. When a drop of water sizzles upon hitting the pan, reduce the heat to medium-low and add the cumin seeds. Toast the seeds for a minute or two, stirring frequently, until the seeds are golden and fragrant. Watch carefully to avoid burning the seeds.</p>
              <p>3. Raise the heat to medium and stir in the onion, garlic, ginger and serrano. Cook for about five minutes, stirring often. Stir in the garam masala (or tikka masala), coriander, turmeric, salt and cayenne (if using), and cook for two more minutes.</p>
              <p>4. Add the whole peeled tomatoes and their juices. Use the back of a wooden spoon to break the tomatoes apart. You can leave some chunks of tomato for texture.</p>
              <p>5. Raise the heat to medium-high and add the chickpeas. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes or longer to allow the flavors to develop.</p>
              <p>6. Serve over basmati rice, if desired, and garnish with a lemon wedge or two and a sprinkle of fresh cilantro.</p>
